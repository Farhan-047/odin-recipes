    <h1>üçú Noodles</h1>
    <p>Noodles are made with semolina and all types of flour, but soft white wheat flour is often preferred. If strong, high-protein flour is used, the noodles are too elastic and chewy when cooked. Weak low-protein flour, however, is also not desirable because the noodles become very sticky or disintegrate when cooked.</p>
